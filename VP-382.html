    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>VP-382 is an anomalous spatial rift located beneath an abandoned asylum in Northern Italy. The anomaly manifests as a large, irregular hole approximately 4 meters in diameter, leading to a dream-like alternate dimension. This dimension is characterized by fluid, surreal landscapes that alter perception and defy known physical laws.</p>

    <h2>Anomalous Properties</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The rift functions as a gateway between our reality and a dangerous dream dimension, causing psychological effects on those nearby.</li>
      <li>Time and space behave inconsistently inside the dimension, with explorers reporting significant temporal dilation and spatial disorientation.</li>
      <li>Individuals entering the dimension experience vivid dreams, hallucinations, and altered states of consciousness that can persist after exit.</li>
      <li>Prolonged exposure often results in severe psychological trauma, memory loss, and in some cases, permanent alteration of perception.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Containment Procedures</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Physical access to VP-382 is strictly prohibited without Level 4 clearance and must be accompanied by a full containment team.</li>
      <li>The perimeter of the asylum is monitored 24/7 using a combination of surveillance drones and fixed security cameras.</li>
      <li>Protective wards have been deployed to dampen the anomalous effects within a 50-meter radius of the rift.</li>
      <li>All personnel assigned to VP-382 must undergo psychological screening before and after exposure, and be subject to mandatory debriefing.</li>
      <li>Exploration and research inside the dream dimension are permitted only under strict supervision, with redundant safety protocols.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Research Notes & Incident Reports</h2>
    <p>Exploration teams consistently report disturbing visions and dream-like sequences that sometimes blur the line between reality and the dimension. Incident VP-382-07 involved the disappearance of a research team, presumed lost to the dream dimension. Continuous investigation is ongoing to understand the mechanics and origin of the rift.</p>
    <p>Hypotheses include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The rift may be a natural tear in the fabric of spacetime induced by unknown forces.</li>
      <li>It might be a manifestation of collective unconscious or shared dream space made physical.</li>
      <li>There may be an intelligent entity or force influencing the anomaly's behavior, though no direct contact has been established.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Personnel Advisory</h2>
    <p>Due to the unpredictable psychological effects, all personnel working with VP-382 are advised to adhere to strict mental health protocols. Psychological support teams are on call for immediate intervention. Unauthorized or unprepared entry into the anomaly is strictly forbidden and punishable by disciplinary action.</p>
