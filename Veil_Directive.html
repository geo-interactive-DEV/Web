        Welcome to The Veil Directive, a secretive organization established in 1931 to protect humanity from Veiled Phenomena — anomalies that exist beyond natural laws, threatening the balance of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Operating from ever-shifting headquarters, our agents contain, research, and neutralize threats unknown to the public eye, all while maintaining the façade of a humanitarian NGO known as “The Veil Foundation.”
