  <div class="disclaimer">
    ⚠️ <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The General Personality and Decision Test (GPAD) is designed based on psychological and behavioral science principles to provide insight into general personality traits and decision-making styles. However, it is not a clinically validated diagnostic tool and should not be used as a substitute for professional psychological assessment or advice. Individual results may vary, and no test can fully capture the complexity of human personality or behavior with 100% accuracy.
